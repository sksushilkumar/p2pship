#summary Instructions on using the SIP interface

= Introduction =

The SIP interface provides SIP-based applications with peer-to-peer communication. Currently it supports
 
 * Media sessions (INVITEs with media parameters)
 * Instant messaging (MESSAGE)

The proxy will act as a media proxy for media sessions if necessary (when the application itself does not support a good [HIP] transport protocol).

It can also act as a router (gateway) for calls destined for outside the peer-to-peer system, for instance for SIP-to-POTS proxies.

The SIP subsystem features also message filtering (SPAM/SPIT control).

== Requirements ==

The SIP interface (or subsystem) has to be enabled when compiling the source. This is the default, but can also be explicitly stated during configure with
{{{ 
./configure --enable-sip 
}}}

This requires the osip library to be installed with development files. Version 2 of osip has generally been used by the authors, although version 3 has been tried successfully in the past. On debian-based systems, this can be installed with
{{{
apt-get install libosip2-dev
}}}

= Configuring =

The core SIP system requires few settings; the local port on which the SIP proxy will be running as well as the behaviour of the media proxy.
