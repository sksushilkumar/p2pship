#summary Notes and ideas for testbed applications

= Apps =

== CoffeeSipper == 

 * Web access:
   * providing a snapshot updated every 10-15 seconds
   * P2PHTTP
   * web-friendly video format (run stream through ffmpeg => flash player)

 * RSS feed on availability
   * When the pot should be ready
   * MOTD updates

 * Wild takes:
   * tweet / sns updates
     * For the p2pweb-sns?
 
 * Client desktop p2phttp widget showing the picture?


== Door plates ==

An app designed to run on the tablet placed beside the office room doors. Point being to replace various name tags, summers, availability indicators.

 * List of the persons that (should) sit in that room
   * Personal info (tel, email, summary, greeting ("im usually here ma-thu 10-15"))

 * Check up status of desktops (ping, filter 24/7 machines)
   * Availability (physical presence)

 * Where people are
   * Physical location. Wifi positioning of personal tablet
     * privacy might be a problem
   * Whether the p2p identity is in the local network (= at work at least)

 * P2P VoIP / IM status (online/offline, status message)

 * Leaving message or calling (p2p voip/im)
   * Usability issues (writing hard on wall, talking akward)

 * Staff could be able to send messages to the plates
   * General info ("HIIT summerparty from 14->. No one will be here")
   * Notification for the people inside ("Remember to pick up the insurance card today!")

== Front door summer ==

Place a tablet outside the front door of the office. Replace the summer by providing more 'intellligent' way of ringing the door bell.

 * check online status of the people inside

 * if the person requested is online, be able to voip him

 * show status messages from staff

 * show general notifications / info.
   * "InnoDoes meeting here, in room 303" => ringing would call up the right person
   * HIIT logo, ads
