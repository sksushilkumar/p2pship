# Introduction #

An environment for testing the SPEAR software has been created at HIIT. The purpose of this testbed is to gain hands-on experience with the concept, hopefully leading to new ideas and research topics.

The testbed is based on using the p2pship prototype on Nokia N810 Internet tablets, using the native SIP-based communication suite ("Internet call/chat") for person-to-person communication. Furthermore, we will explore other ways in which the p2p framework can be used in an office environment. This will be done through special _applications_ which utilize the prototypes interfaces (SIP or HTTP currently).

# Apps #

Currently we are experimenting with the following applications:
